# CR-001 — Homeown Calculator UI Refactor
## Verdict-First Layout & Brand Alignment

**Change Request ID:** CR-001  
**Product:** Homeown Reality Check (calc.homeown.ie)  
**Status:** Approved for implementation  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** UX / UI / Information Architecture  
**Breaking Logic Changes:** No (UI + composition only)

---

## 1. Summary

The current calculator is functionally correct but presents as a long, form-led experience.  
This change request restructures the UI to be **verdict-first**, calmer, and more clearly aligned to the Homeown brand.

The core logic, calculations, and rules **do not change**.  
Only presentation, hierarchy, and component composition are affected.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Current issues observed:

- The **verdict does not land emotionally** — it feels buried.
- Users must scroll before seeing why the tool matters.
- Results and inputs compete for attention.
- The mortgage section appears even when unavailable, creating confusion.
- The experience feels like a “calculator” rather than a **reality check**.

This weakens clarity, trust, and engagement — especially on mobile.

---

## 3. Design Principle (Non-Negotiable)

> **The verdict is the product. Everything else supports it.**

The UI must:
- surface the verdict immediately,
- reduce vertical scanning,
- feel calm, neutral, and non-salesy,
- guide users through inputs without tabs or modals.

---

## 4. High-Level UI Changes

### 4.1 Introduce a Sticky Verdict Banner (New)

Add a persistent banner at the top of the page that updates live.

**Content:**
- Primary line (large):
  - “Verdict: You never catch the deposit (within 40 years)”  
  **or**
  - “Verdict: You catch the deposit in 4 years 2 months”
- Secondary stats (small):
  - Deposit target today
  - Age at catch (or “Not reached”)
- Active verdict bucket badge

**Behaviour:**
- Sticky on scroll (mobile + desktop)
- Updates immediately as inputs change

**Components:**
- `Alert`
- `Badge`

---

### 4.2 Replace “Results” Card with Collapsible Details (Change)

Remove the standalone “Results” card.

Replace with:
- **Result Details** section
- Collapsed by default
- Opened via “View details” action under the verdict banner

**Contents:**
- Projected property value at catch
- Projected deposit target at catch
- Total savings at catch (today’s euros)
- Rule-of-thumb affordability explanation
- Mortgage estimate (conditional)

**Components:**
- `Collapsible`
- `Card`
- `Separator`

---

### 4.3 Inputs Restructured into a 3-Step Flow (Same Page)

No tabs. No navigation resets.

#### Step 1 — Your target
- Target property price (today)
- Deposit %
- Current savings

#### Step 2 — Your savings pace
- Monthly savings contribution
- Net monthly income
- Need expenses
- Want expenses
- Disposable (inline, read-only)

#### Step 3 — Assumptions
- Inflation rate slider
- Property price appreciation slider

Each step must have:
- clear heading
- one-line explanation
- tight vertical spacing

**Components:**
- `Card`
- `Input`
- `Select`
- `Slider`
- `Label`

---

### 4.4 Mortgage Estimate Becomes Conditional Content (Change)

Mortgage estimate must **not** appear as a full card by default.

Rules:
- Shown only when:
  - deposit is reachable AND
  - age is provided
- Otherwise:
  - show a single-line note inside Result Details:
    > “Mortgage estimate appears once the deposit is reachable.”

**Components:**
- `Collapsible`
- `Alert`
- `Slider`
- `Badge`

---

### 4.5 Optional Section Navigation (New, Lightweight)

Add a small anchor row below the verdict banner:

- Target
- Savings pace
- Assumptions
- Details

Purpose:
- reduce scroll fatigue on mobile
- no state, no JS routing

**Components:**
- `Button` (ghost / secondary)
- anchor links only

---

## 5. Brand & Copy Adjustments

### Language changes
- “Results” → **“Your reality check”**
- Keep:
  - “Diagnostic only”
  - “Indicative only”
  - “No tracking”
- Move “UK English – EUR” to footer or small note (not a pill)

### Visual tone
- More whitespace
- Fewer borders
- Clear typographic hierarchy
- No dense paragraphs at the top of the page

---

## 6. New / Updated Components

**New**
- `VerdictBanner.tsx`
- `ResultDetails.tsx`
- `SectionNav.tsx` (anchors only)

**Updated**
- Existing Results logic → moved into `ResultDetails`
- Mortgage logic → conditional rendering only

---

## 7. Explicit Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- No logic or formula changes
- No charts or graphs
- No tabs, modals, or toasts
- No tracking or analytics
- No Homeown pathway comparison

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

- Verdict is visible immediately on page load
- Verdict remains visible while scrolling
- Results feel secondary and optional
- Mortgage section never appears prematurely
- UI reads as calm, neutral, and authoritative
- Mobile experience requires minimal scrolling
- No regression in calculation behaviour

---

## 9. Definition of Done

- Verdict banner implemented and sticky
- Results card removed and replaced with collapsible details
- Inputs grouped into 3 clear steps
- Mortgage estimate conditional only
- Copy aligned with Homeown tone
- Reviewed on mobile and desktop
- Deployed to calc.homeown.ie

---

## 10. Rationale (Context for Devs)

This calculator is not trying to impress — it is trying to **explain reality clearly and honestly**.

If a user leaves saying:
> “At least now I understand why this feels impossible.”

Then the UI has done its job.
