# CR-006 — Add Contextual CTA Card (Bucket-Based, Homeown-Aligned)

## Homeown Deposit Catch Diagnostic (Simple v1)

**Change Request ID:** CR-006  
**Product:** calc.homeown.ie  
**Status:** Approved for implementation  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** UX / Conversion / Content (new UI section)  
**Depends on:** CR-002 (Simplification Pivot), CR-003 (UI Layout), CR-004 (Copy), CR-005 (Maths Fix)  
**Logic Changes:** Minor (bucket → CTA mapping only)

---

## 1. Summary

Add a **third card** below *“Your deposit reality”* that presents a **bucket-specific next step**, written in language consistent with Homeown’s documented pathway model:

- Pathway Participation Agreement (PPA)
- Monthly equity building (formerly Pathway Credits / now MQM)
- Fixed acquisition price
- Diagnostic, not advisory positioning

The CTA must explain *why* Homeown may be relevant for the user’s situation, without promises or pressure.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Convert high-intent users without sales pressure  
- Frame Homeown as a **structured alternative pathway**, not a workaround  
- Reflect the real mechanics of the Homeown model (price fixing, equity accumulation)  
- Maintain trust with users who may not need Homeown  

---

## 3. Non-Goals

- No new calculator inputs  
- No pop-ups or forced flows  
- No mortgage approval claims  
- No product pricing or comparisons  
- No recommendations or advice language  

---

## 4. Placement & UI Requirements

### 4.1 Placement
- Render a new `Card` immediately below the *Results* card
- On mobile, this should follow directly after the verdict meter

### 4.2 Components (shadcn/ui)
- `Card`
- `CardHeader`
- `CardContent`
- `Button`
- `Separator` (optional)

### 4.3 Visual Tone
- Calm, restrained, consistent with Homeown brand
- One primary CTA per bucket
- Copy should remain short and readable on mobile

---

## 5. Data & Logic

### 5.1 Inputs
The CTA card is driven by existing outputs only:
- `bucket` (enum)
- `timeToSave` (months or “Not reachable”)

No additional calculations required.

### 5.2 Buckets
Use existing bucket values:
- `CANT_SAVE`
- `OVER_5Y`
- `UNDER_5Y`
- `DEPOSIT_SAVED`
- `INCOME_MISMATCH` (if surfaced separately)

---

## 6. Copy Specification (Aligned to Homeown Docs)

**Global helper line (shown above CTA content in all cases):**

> Based on the inputs you entered above.

Tone requirements:
- Diagnostic, not directive  
- Precise and plain-spoken  
- No marketing hype  
- No judgement  

---

### 6.1 Bucket — CANT_SAVE

**Headline**  
> You’re not falling behind — the goalpost is moving.

**Body**  
> When property prices rise faster than savings, the deposit target keeps moving away.  
> Homeown is designed for this situation, allowing you to live in the home while building equity at a fixed purchase price.

**Primary CTA**  
> See how the Homeown pathway works

**Secondary (optional)**  
> Talk to us about your situation

**Muted note**  
> We’ll explain the structure clearly and tell you honestly whether it’s appropriate.

---

### 6.2 Bucket — OVER_5Y

**Headline**  
> You can get there — but the market stays in control.

**Body**  
> Even steady savers remain exposed to rising prices while building a deposit.  
> Homeown fixes the purchase price upfront and converts monthly payments into pathway equity over time.

**Primary CTA**  
> Compare your current path with Homeown

**Secondary (optional)**  
> Understand how the pathway works

---

### 6.3 Bucket — UNDER_5Y

**Headline**  
> You’re in a strong position.

**Body**  
> You may not need Homeown.  
> Some people in this position still choose it to remove market risk while preparing for a mortgage.

**Primary CTA**  
> See when Homeown makes sense

**Secondary (optional)**  
> When it doesn’t

---

### 6.4 Bucket — DEPOSIT_SAVED

**Headline**  
> You’ve done the hard part.

**Body**  
> If you’re not ready to buy immediately, Homeown can purchase the home and allow you to build further equity while preparing for a mortgage — at a fixed price.

**Primary CTA**  
> Learn how the Homeown pathway works

**Secondary (optional)**  
> Buying now vs waiting

---

### 6.5 Bucket — INCOME_MISMATCH (if shown)

**Headline**  
> The deposit is achievable — income is the constraint.

**Body**  
> When income limits mortgage size, the deposit requirement increases.  
> Homeown can support deposit-ready but mortgage-limited clients through a structured pathway to ownership.

**Primary CTA**  
> Talk to Homeown

**Muted note**  
> Rule-of-thumb only. We’ll explain what this means in practice.

---

## 7. Link & Context Passing

### 7.1 Destination
All primary CTAs link to a single page:
- `/talk-to-homeown`

### 7.2 Query Params
Append context for attribution:
- `bucket`
- `months`
- `tpp` (optional)
- `ghi` (optional)

Example:
```

/talk-to-homeown?bucket=CANT_SAVE&months=na&tpp=400000&ghi=100000

```

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

- CTA card renders for all bucket states  
- Copy matches Section 6 exactly  
- One primary CTA per bucket  
- No changes to calculator maths or inputs  
- Mobile layout remains clean and readable  

---

## 9. Definition of Done

- `CtaCard` component implemented  
- Bucket → copy mapping complete  
- Links wired with query params  
- QA across all buckets  
- Deployed to calc.homeown.ie
