# CR-003 — UI Layout Alignment to “Card Sketch” (Shadcn)
## Simple v1 (Deposit Catch Diagnostic)

**Change Request ID:** CR-003  
**Product:** calc.homeown.ie  
**Status:** Approved for implementation  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** UI / Layout / Interaction  
**Depends on:** CR-002 (Simplification Pivot)  
**Logic Changes:** No (presentation only; uses CR-002 logic)

---

## 1. Summary

Implement a mobile-first UI layout matching the approved hand-drawn “card sketch”.
The layout must feel calm, minimal, and fast to navigate, while using **shadcn/ui** components consistently.

The UI structure is:
1) Header (title + reset)  
2) Input block with sliders (5 inputs)  
3) Output block (time + deposit required)  
4) Pathway bucket meter (4 buckets)

---

## 2. Goals

- Mirror the sketch’s hierarchy: inputs are simple, outputs are prominent, verdict is obvious.
- Reduce vertical scanning and remove unnecessary sections/cards.
- Use sliders for fast input on mobile.
- Ensure the results and bucket outcome are easy to read at a glance.

---

## 3. Non-Goals

- No mortgage section (v1).
- No inflation/expenses/age (removed in CR-002).
- No charts, tabs, modals, or toasts.
- No routing changes (single page).

---

## 4. Required shadcn/ui Components

Install list:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add \
  card \
  slider \
  label \
  button \
  badge \
  separator
```

Optional (only if used sparingly):
- `tooltip`

---

## 5. Page Layout Specification

### 5.1 Header Bar (Top Row)
Left:
- “HOMEOWN CALCULATOR” (small caps / letter spacing)
- “calc.homeown.ie” (muted text)

Right:
- Reset button

Components:
- `Button` (variant: `secondary` or `ghost`)

Acceptance:
- Reset is always visible without scrolling.

---

### 5.2 Inputs Card (Primary Interaction Block)

Use a single `Card` containing all 5 inputs in this order:

1) Gross Household Income (annual)
2) Target Property Price (today)
3) Two-column row:
   - Current Savings (today)
   - Monthly Savings
4) Property Price Appreciation (annual %)

Components:
- `Card`
- `Label`
- `Slider`
- Optional: `Badge` for showing the current slider value (e.g. “6%”)

#### Field Pattern (standardised)
For each slider field:
- `Label`
- Large formatted value (e.g. “€100,000”)
- `Slider` beneath
- Small helper note (optional; very short)

Formatting:
- Currency values displayed with € and thousand separators.
- Percent displayed with one decimal (e.g. 6.0%).

Layout:
- Mobile: single column
- Desktop: current savings + monthly savings in a two-column grid

---

### 5.3 Outputs Card (“Time to Save” + “Deposit Required”)

Use a single `Card` immediately below inputs. This is the “hero output”.

Contents:
- “Time to save” (years + months or “Never”)
- “Deposit required” (value at catch or “—”)
- Optional badge: “Indicative only”

Components:
- `Card`
- `Badge`
- `Separator` (optional)

Typography:
- Output values must be visually dominant (larger than labels).
- Keep labels muted.

Empty state:
- If required inputs missing, show a calm prompt (not an error).

---

### 5.4 Bucket Meter (“Your current pathway”)

Below the Outputs Card, render a 4-bucket pathway meter that matches the sketch.

Buckets (left to right):
1. Can’t save deposit
2. Will save deposit > 5y
3. Will save deposit ≤ 5y
4. Target looks high vs income (rule-of-thumb)

Rules:
- Exactly one bucket is highlighted.
- A short sentence above the meter states the bucket outcome, e.g.:
  “Will save deposit > 5 years.”

Implementation:
- Prefer a custom segmented bar (4 equal segments) using Tailwind divs.
- Use `Badge` to display the active bucket label.
- Do not use complex charts.

Components:
- `Badge`
- (Optional) `Separator`
- Custom meter built from `div` segments (recommended)

Copy requirements:
- If Bucket 4 is selected, add “Rule-of-thumb only” beside the label.

---

## 6. Spacing & Interaction Rules

- Inputs should require minimal scrolling on mobile.
- Keep padding consistent across cards (e.g. `p-4` / `p-6`).
- No dense explanatory paragraphs.
- Sliders should be easy to grab on mobile (increase thumb hit area if needed).
- Results update instantly as sliders move.

---

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- Layout matches the “card sketch” hierarchy and flow.
- Only the 5 CR-002 inputs are present.
- Outputs are prominent and readable on mobile.
- Bucket meter clearly communicates the user’s category.
- Reset works and returns all values to defaults.
- No references to mortgage, inflation, or expenses appear anywhere in the UI.
- Consistent use of shadcn/ui components as specified.

---

## 8. Definition of Done

- Header + reset implemented
- Inputs card implemented with sliders and formatted values
- Outputs card implemented (time + deposit)
- Bucket meter implemented (4 segments + highlighted state)
- Mobile QA complete
- Deployed to calc.homeown.ie
