# CR-002 — Calculator Simplification Pivot (Simple v1)
## Deposit Catch Diagnostic

**Change Request ID:** CR-002  
**Product:** Homeown Reality Check (calc.homeown.ie)  
**Status:** Approved for implementation  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Product scope reduction / UX simplification  
**Breaking Logic Changes:** Yes (removal of advanced inputs & outputs)

---

## 1. Summary

This change request formalises a **pivot to a simpler v1 calculator**, aligned with the working Google Sheets prototype.

The goal is to ship a **fast, clear, mobile-first diagnostic** that answers one question only:

> **Can I catch the deposit for the home I want — and how long will it take?**

All non-essential complexity is removed for v1.

---

## 2. Rationale

The current calculator:
- is technically correct but cognitively heavy,
- requires too many inputs for first-time users,
- dilutes the core insight with secondary concepts (inflation, expenses, mortgage logic).

The simplified model:
- is easier to understand,
- matches real user intuition,
- is faster to complete,
- produces a clear bucketed outcome suitable for social traffic.

This is a **product clarity decision**, not a technical regression.

## 3. New Scope: Simple v1 Calculator

### 3.1 Inputs (5 only)

The calculator will collect **only** the following:

1. **Target Property Price (TPP)**  
2. **Gross Household Income (GHI)**  
3. **Current Savings**  
4. **Monthly Savings**  
5. **Property Price Appreciation (annual %)**  

**Removed inputs (out of scope for v1):**
- Inflation rate
- Net income
- Needs / wants expenses
- Age
- Mortgage rate / term
- Any discretionary assumptions

---

### 3.2 Outputs (3 only)

The calculator will output:

1. **Deposit required today**  
   - Fixed at **10% of TPP** for v1
2. **Time to save the deposit**
   - Months
   - Displayed as years + months
   - Or “Never” (within horizon)
3. **Deposit required at catch**
   - If catchable
   - Otherwise display “—”

---

## 4. Calculation Logic (Simple Model)

### 4.1 Fixed assumptions
- Deposit percentage: **10%**
- Time horizon: **40 years (480 months)**

### 4.2 Monthly property growth
```

monthly_growth = (1 + PPA)^(1/12) − 1

```

### 4.3 Deposit target over time
```

deposit(t) = 0.10 × TPP × (1 + monthly_growth)^t

```

### 4.4 Savings over time
```

savings(t) = currentSavings + monthlySavings × t

```

### 4.5 Catch condition
Find the earliest month `t` such that:
```

savings(t) ≥ deposit(t)

```

If no such `t ≤ 480` exists → result = **Never**.

No inflation adjustment in v1.

---

## 5. Verdict Buckets (4)

Each user must be placed into **exactly one** bucket.

### Bucket 1 — Will never save deposit
- Condition: no catch within 480 months

### Bucket 2 — Will save deposit, but > 5 years
- Condition: catchable AND monthsToCatch > 60

### Bucket 3 — Will save deposit in ≤ 5 years
- Condition: catchable AND monthsToCatch ≤ 60

### Bucket 4 — Target looks high vs income (rule-of-thumb)
- Condition:
```

TPP > (4 × GHI) + depositToday

```

**Notes:**
- Bucket 4 overrides Buckets 2 and 3
- Must be labelled clearly as **rule-of-thumb only**
- Not a lending decision

---

## 6. UI Changes Required

### 6.1 Remove the following sections entirely
- Monthly picture (needs / wants)
- Inflation slider
- Mortgage estimate section
- Advanced assumptions
- Any collapsible advanced logic

### 6.2 Simplified UI Structure
- One input card (“Your details”)
- One results card (“Your deposit reality”)
- Verdict bucket displayed prominently
- No stepper, no tabs, no advanced mode toggle (for v1)

---

## 7. Copy & Positioning Guardrails

Required copy inclusions:
- “Diagnostic only”
- “Indicative only”
- “This tool does not assess mortgage approval or lending eligibility.”

Avoid:
- “Affordability”
- “Approval”
- “Guaranteed”
- “Deposit free”

---

## 8. Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

- Inflation modelling
- Disposable income validation
- Mortgage repayment estimates
- Age-based lending logic
- Scenario comparison
- Save/share functionality

These may return in **v2**.

---

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- Calculator accepts only 5 inputs
- Outputs only 3 values + verdict bucket
- Bucket logic is deterministic
- “Never” state works correctly
- UI is usable in under 30 seconds on mobile
- Matches Google Sheets prototype behaviour
- Deployed to calc.homeown.ie

---

## 10. Definition of Done

- Advanced inputs removed
- Logic updated to simple model
- Buckets implemented as specified
- Copy updated to match scope
- Mobile and desktop QA completed
- Stakeholder sign-off on bucket outcomes

---

## 11. Context for Dev Team

This calculator is **not** trying to solve homeownership.

It is trying to explain **why people feel stuck** — quickly, honestly, and without judgement.

If a user understands *why* the deposit keeps moving away from them, the product has succeeded.
