# CR-004 — Copy, Tone & Header Refinement
## Homeown Deposit Catch Diagnostic (Simple v1)

**Change Request ID:** CR-004  
**Product:** calc.homeown.ie  
**Status:** Approved for implementation  
**Priority:** Medium–High  
**Type:** Copy / UX Tone / Content Hierarchy  
**Depends on:** CR-002 (Simplification Pivot), CR-003 (UI Layout)  
**Logic Changes:** No (copy-only)

---

## 1. Summary

This change request updates **all user-facing copy** in the calculator to better align with the Homeown brand:

- Calm, explanatory, non-judgemental
- Focused on *why* people feel stuck, not just outcomes
- Clear without sounding technical or legalistic

No calculation or UI structure changes are required.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Replace generic or mechanical language with human, explanatory copy
- Improve emotional clarity across all four result states
- Strengthen the header to frame the calculator as a “reality check”, not a tool
- Ensure copy is socially shareable (screenshots should read well out of context)

---

## 3. Header & Global Copy Changes

### 3.1 Page Header

**Replace existing header text with:**

**Primary (H1):**  
> A calm reality check on saving a deposit

**Secondary (muted):**  
> See whether your savings can catch a moving property market.

Keep:
- Reset button (top-right)
- “Indicative only” badge

Remove or de-emphasise:
- “Calculator” as the primary label (can remain in footer/meta)

---

### 3.2 Global Disclaimer

**Replace:**  
> This tool does not assess mortgage approval or lending eligibility.

**With:**  
> This tool looks only at saving a deposit. Mortgage approval depends on lenders and other factors.

Tone must be calm and non-legalistic.

---

## 4. Inputs Card Copy

### Section Title

**Replace:**  
> Your details  
> Five inputs to calculate your deposit saving pathway.

**With:**  
> Your starting point  
> Adjust the sliders to reflect your situation today.

---

### Field-Level Copy Adjustments

**Gross household income (annual)**  
- Keep label
- Add helper (small text, once only):
  > Used only as a high-level sense check. Not a lending assessment.

**Target property price (today)**  
- Change label to:
  > Target property price (current market)

**Monthly savings**  
- Change label to:
  > Monthly savings (towards a deposit)

**Property price appreciation (annual)**  
- Add helper text:
  > How fast prices are rising in the areas you’re considering.

Other input labels remain unchanged.

---

## 5. Results Card Copy

### Section Title

Keep:
> Your deposit reality

### Subtitle

**Replace:**  
> Time to save the deposit and the target amount.

**With:**  
> How long it takes to reach the deposit — if at all.

---

## 6. State-Specific Copy (All 4 Outcomes)

The calculator must display **state-specific language** based on the bucket outcome.

### 6.1 State: Can’t Save Deposit

**TIME TO SAVE:**  
> Not reachable

**Supporting line (small):**  
> At this saving rate and price growth, the deposit keeps moving out of reach.

**Bucket label:**  
> Can’t save deposit

**Explanation text:**  
> Even over a long time horizon, rising prices outpace monthly savings under these assumptions.

---

### 6.2 State: Will Save Deposit > 5 Years

**TIME TO SAVE:**  
> X years Y months

**Explanation text:**  
> The deposit is reachable, but it takes longer than five years at this saving pace.

**Bucket label:**  
> Will save deposit > 5 years

---

### 6.3 State: Will Save Deposit ≤ 5 Years

**TIME TO SAVE:**  
> X years Y months

**Explanation text:**  
> The deposit is reachable within five years under current assumptions.

**Bucket label:**  
> Will save deposit ≤ 5 years

---

### 6.4 State: Deposit Already Saved

**TIME TO SAVE:**  
> Deposit already saved

**Supporting line:**  
> Your current savings meet the 10% deposit required at today’s prices.

**Bucket label:**  
> Deposit saved

Do not display “0 years 0 months” in this state.

---

## 7. Bucket Meter Copy

### Bucket Labels (shortened)

Replace existing labels with:
- Can’t save
- > 5 years
- ≤ 5 years
- Deposit saved

### Mandatory Outcome Sentence (above meter)

Always display one sentence summarising the outcome, e.g.:
- “At this saving rate, the deposit never catches up.”
- “You’ll save the deposit, but it takes more than five years.”
- “You’ll save the deposit within five years.”
- “You already have the required deposit.”

This sentence is more important than the visual bar.

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

- All copy matches this CR verbatim (minor punctuation OK)
- No technical or legal-heavy language remains
- “Never” is replaced with “Not reachable” in the UI
- “0 years 0 months” is never shown
- All four states read clearly when screenshotted
- Tone feels calm, explanatory, and non-judgemental

---

- Results card copy updated
- All four states verified in UI
